# Virtual-Painter
A hand-gesture-based virtual painting application that allows users to draw in the air using just their fingers. Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe, this project uses hand detection and finger tracking to simulate drawing on a canvas.

## Features
Hand detection and finger tracking using MediaPipe

Gesture-based controls:

Index + Middle finger → Select tool or color

Only Index finger → Draw

Color and eraser selection via on-screen menu

Clear the canvas with C, exit with ESC

Real-time drawing with live webcam feed

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+

- OpenCV

- MediaPipe

- Numpy
